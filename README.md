Replication code for "Socioeconomic Roots of Academic Faculty". Due to the substantial risk of re-identification, the personally identifiable information it contains, and the terms of the consent agreement by participants, we cannot make the underlying data set publicly available. However, we are happy to share the data under an IRB-approved data sharing agreement that carries through appropriate protections for limiting the risk of re-identification.
